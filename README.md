# Classification-of-Machine-Failures

This task's problem revolves around predicting Machine Failures. The dataset is synthetically generated based on this dataset. The data contains 136429 rows and 14 columns, 5 of which are binary features of failure areas and 1 binary feature indicating the presence of machine failure regarding the area.

Predicting machine failure can be crucial in order to support predictive maintenance, which will support both effective business and operations management. Successfully implementing a predictive maintenance model will lower production costs while also keeping production quality high.
